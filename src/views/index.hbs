    <p class="main__post-text">PROSPERO
            Of the king's ship
            The mariners say how thou hast disposed
            And all the rest o' the fleet.
            ARIEL
            Safely in harbour
            Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
            Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
            From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
            The mariners all under hatches stow'd;



            Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
            I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
            Which I dispersed, they all have met again
            And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
            Bound sadly home for Naples,
            Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
            And his great person perish.
            PROSPERO
            Ariel, thy charge
            Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
            What is the time o' the day?

    <p class="main__post-text">Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn't been a happy practice session. Fred and George, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like missiles.

As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under his breath, ". . . don't fulfill their requirements . . . half an inch, if that . . ."

"Hello, Nick," said Harry.

"Hello, hello," said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside.

"You look troubled, young Potter," said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet.

"So do you," said Harry.

"Ah," Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, "a matter of no importance. . . . It's not as though I really wanted to join. . . . Thought I'd apply, but apparently I 'don't fulfill requirements' -"

In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.
