            Of the king's ship
            The mariners say how thou hast disposed
            And all the rest o' the fleet.
            ARIEL
            Safely in harbour
            Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
            Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
            From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
            The mariners all under hatches stow'd;



            Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
            I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
            Which I dispersed, they all have met again
            And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
            Bound sadly home for Naples,
            Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
            And his great person perish.
            PROSPERO
            Ariel, thy charge
            Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
            What is the time o' the day?
